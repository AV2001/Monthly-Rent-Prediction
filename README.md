# Monthly Rent Prediction (Linear Regression)
## Project Overview

This particular Machine Learning project was built using the Flask framework, and the purpose of the ML model that runs behind the scenes, is to predict the monthly rent in the borough of Manhattan, located in the city that never sleeps - New York.

## How Does It Work?

To keep things simple, the user will pass several values (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and the square foot of the house) to the HTML form's input boxes. These values will then be fed to the Linear Regression algorithm, that model that will be used in this project, which in turn helps predict the rent of the house.

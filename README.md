# Monthly Rent Prediction (Using Linear Regression)

## Project Overview
This particular Machine Learning project was built using the Flask framework, and the purpose of the ML model that runs behind the scenes, is to predict the monthly rent in the borough of Manhattan, located in the city that never sleeps - New York.

## How Does It Work?
To keep things simple, the user will pass several values (number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and the square footage of the house) to the HTML form's input boxes. These values will then be fed to the Linear Regression algorithm, which in turn helps predict the rent of the house.

## Demo
In case if you would like to get an idea of how the web application actually works, it has been deployed to Heroku.
